# simple image editor
First attempt at python programming. Went with tkinter as gui platform and pil(low) for image processing.
Code written in pycharm ide (though jupyter notebook + anaconda is also good). Learned how to install and import python modules and work with widgets (sliders, buttons, checkboxes etc). Functionality include:
  - adjusting colour, brightness & contrast
  - image rotation
  - image resizing
  - applying filters (blur, median, emboss, poster etc.)
  - colour filters
