# simple image editor
First attempt at python to familiarise myself with the language. Went with tkinter as gui platform and pil(low) for image processing.
Code written in pycharm ide. Good intro on how to install and import python modules, work with widgets (sliders, buttons, checkboxes etc) and their placements.
